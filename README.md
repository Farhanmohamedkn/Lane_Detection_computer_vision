# 🛣️ Lane Detection using OpenCV
This is a simple computer vision project for detecting lane lines in road videos using OpenCV. The goal is to process frames from a driving video and highlight the lane markings, which is essential for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

# 📌 Project Overview
The project involves:

Processing video frames from a dashboard camera

Detecting lane lines using edge detection and masking techniques

Drawing the detected lanes on the original frame

Creating an output video with visualized lane detection

# 🧰 Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

NumPy
